Cross-Platform System Monitoring · PowerShell 7 · Linux Administration

This project demonstrates how to install, configure, and run PowerShell 7 on Ubuntu Linux, then build and execute a fully cross-platform system monitoring script capable of running on Linux and Windows using a shared codebase.

## 📖 The walkthrough includes:

Installing PowerShell on Ubuntu

Writing PowerShell scripts using the Nano text editor

Implementing OS detection (Linux vs. Windows)

Gathering system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Uptime)

Exporting monitoring data to JSON and CSV

Running, validating, and reviewing stored reports

This project is part of my System & Process Management learning path and demonstrates how PowerShell can be used as a versatile automation tool across platforms.
