🚀 Running PowerShell on Ubuntu
Cross-Platform System Monitoring · PowerShell 7 · Linux Administration

This project demonstrates how to install, configure, and run PowerShell 7 on Ubuntu Linux, then build and execute a fully cross-platform system monitoring script capable of running on Linux and Windows using a shared codebase.

## 📖 The walkthrough includes:
- Installing PowerShell on Ubuntu
- Exploring the PowerShell environment in Ubuntu
- File & Directory Management
- System & Process Management
- Writing PowerShell scripts using the Nano text editor
- Implementing OS detection (Linux vs. Windows)
- Gathering system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Uptime)
- Exporting monitoring data to JSON and CSV
- Running, validating, and reviewing stored reports

This project is part of my System & Process Management learning path and demonstrates how PowerShell can be used as a versatile automation tool across platforms.
